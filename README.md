## How was code tested 
For the image inversion action the output was tested against a online image inversion and was continually refined until they looked identical. Throughout the project, code was tested with the use of println statements to see the output. Alongside the use of print statements a large portion of testing was performed through trial and error of running the ANDIE program and seeing the outcome of using different parts of the GUI.

## Known Issues

- When selecting a region of the image, areas beyond the image are able to be selected
- Drawing a shape or line requires selecting an area first, before the drawing is applied
- After drawing a shape or line, the thickness, colour or size cannot be changed
- Keyboard shortcuts are not the conventional shortcuts 
- The application restarts when the language is changed, so any image that is open or edited is lost

## Brief User Guide 
Once the user has ran the application from within the Gradle projects a new window will appear. This is the ANDIE GUI (Graphical User Interface). Within this GUI there are 10 options in the menu.
As ANDIE is a Non-destructive image editor we suggest the user to open a file of type '.png'. Once opened a file the user has complete freedom with how they decide to experience ANDIE. Each menu bar represents a different set of features such as View, Filters, Colour and Image. If the user applies a unwanted feature then the edit menu bar is helpful as it has the ability to undo and redo actions. If the image has reached its desired state then the user should 'save as' if wanting to save as an operations file 'ops' or export if wanting to create a copy of exsisting image without the change history.

## No Significant Code Refactoring
